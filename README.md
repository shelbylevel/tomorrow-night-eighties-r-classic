### 🎨 Palette

**Tomorrow Night Eighties (R Classic)** is a dark, high contrast, MIT-licensed color theme. Tomorrow Night Eighties is one of the variants included in the [Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme originally written by Chris Kempson.

This theme has two major inspirations: the editor is inspired by Posit's implementation of Tomorrow Night Eighties in the RStudio IDE, and the workbench (everything outside the editor pane) is inspired by Microsoft's implementation of Tomorrow Night Eighties.
